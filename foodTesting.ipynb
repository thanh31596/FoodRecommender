Do not make a lip. You may end up with a rectangle rather than a circle; the shape is unimportant, but do take care to maintain an even thickness.\\nWhen the fire is hot (when you can hold your hand over the coals for 3 to 4 seconds at a distance of 5 inches), use your fingertips to lift the dough gently by the 2 corners closest to you, and drape in onto the grill. Catch the loose edge on the grill first and slide the remaining dough into place over the fire. Within a minute the dough will puff slightly, the underside will stiffen, and grill marks will appear.\\nUsing tongs, immediately flip the crust over, onto the coolest part of the grill. Quickly brush the grilled surface with olive oil. Scatter the garlic and cheeses over the dough, and spoon dollops of tomato over the cheese. Do not cover the entire surface of the pizza with tomatoes. Finally, drizzle the pizza with 1 to 2 tablespoons of olive oil.\\nSlide the pizza back toward the hot coals, but not directly over them. Using tongs, rotate the pizza frequently so that different sections receive high heat; check the underside often to see that it is not burning. The pizza is done when the top is bubbly and the cheese melted, about 6 to 8 minutes. Serve at once, topped with the basil leaves and additional olive oil, if desired.\\nPizza Dough: Sprinkle the yeast over 1/2 cup warm (105 to 110 degrees F) water and allow it to dissolve and activate, about 5 minutes. Combine the flour and salt and mound it onto a cool work surface creating a high walled well in the center. Combine the yeast mixture with 1 1/2 cups of cool water and pour into the well. Slowly begin to mix the water and flour, a little at a time, moving your fingers in short, counter clockwise circles around the border of the water. When the dough is firm enough to hold it's shape, scrape the remaining flour over it and knead until the mass is smooth and shiny, approximately 7 minutes. Transfer the dough to a bowl that has been brushed with olive oil. Brush the top of the dough with olive oil to prevent a skin from forming, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place away from drafts until doubled in bulk, about 2 hours. Punch down the dough and knead once more. Let the dough rise again for about 40 minutes, punch down again and form dough into 4 balls.\\nCombine all the ingredients in a heavy saucepan. Bring to a boil, lower the heat to very low, and gently simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside for 30 minutes so the flavors continue to infuse the oil as it cools\\nStrain the oil into a clean jar.

       " 'Y9scOUYH1Fdw8kC2/inyTPTBAW.bRue': {'instructions': 'In the top half of a double boiler set over barely simmering water, stir the chocolate until melted. Using a pastry brush, brush the baked pie shell up to the rim with the melted chocolate. Set aside to cool and harden at room temperature or, uncovered, in the refrigerator. In a large saucepan, bring the milk, cream of coconut, and vanilla bean to a simmer over medium heat. Immediately turn off the heat and set aside to infuse for 15 minutes.\\nMeanwhile, in a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or using a hand mixer), whip the egg yolks and sugar together until pale yellow and fluffy. With the mixer running at low speed, mix in the cornstarch, then gradually pour in the hot milk mixture.\\nStrain the mixture back into the saucepan to smooth it and remove the vanilla bean. Whisking constantly, cook over medium-high heat until thick and just boiling. When the mixture thickens, the whisk will leave trail marks on the bottom of the pot and the mixture will have a few large bubbles boiling up to the top. Pour the mixture into a medium bowl and stir in the butter. Half-fill a large bowl with ice water. Rest the bowl containing the custard in the ice water and let cool, stirring frequently to cool the mixture. When the custard is cool, whip the cream until stiff. Fold the whipped cream and coconut into the custard. Pour the mixture into the chocolate-coated pie shell and smooth the top. Refrigerate uncovered at least 2 hours. (Or refrigerate until ready to serve, up to 24 hours.) Serve cold.\\nIn a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or using a hand mixer), mix the flour, salt, and sugar for 1 minute. Add the butter and mix just until you have a crumbly, sandy mixture. You should still be able to see the pieces of butter. In a small bowl, stir the water and vinegar together. With the mixer running at medium speed, drizzle in the water-vinegar mixture and mix just until a dough forms. You should still see small bits of butter.\\nTurn out onto a work surface, divide the dough in 1/2, and shape into 2 round, flat disks. Wrap separately in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes before using. (Or, refrigerate up to 48 hours or freeze up to 1 month before using. If frozen, let thaw in the refrigerator overnight before rolling out.) When the time comes to roll out the dough, let the dough warm up for a few minutes at room temperature. Dust a work surface with just a few tablespoons of flour and keep some extra flour at hand. If you like, you can roll out the dough between 2 sheets of waxed paper (flouring the bottom sheet and the top of the dough before rolling), which makes it much easier to transfer to the pan later on. However, you won\\'t be able to check the progress of the dough as easily. It\\'s entirely up to you.\\nSprinkle a little flour on top of the dough and start rolling outward from the center with quick, light strokes. Don\\'t worry if the edges split a bit; concentrate on getting a good circle going from the center. Lift up and rotate the dough 1/4 turn every minute or so to help ensure even rolling. The dough should feel smooth and soft; some say it should feel like the inside of your forearm. If it gets sticky, sprinkle on a bit more flour, but don\\'t do this more than 2 or 3 times; the dough will absorb too much flour. Instead, put it back in refrigerator for 15 minutes to firm the butter up. Keep rolling until the circle is at least 2 inches larger than your pan (for example, 11 inches wide for a 9-inch pie pan), or 3 inches larger for deep-dish pies.\\nSet your pie or tart pan nearby. We always use heavy aluminum pans, because glass pans seem to bake the crust too fast. However, we know that the advantage of glass is that you can easily check the color of the crust. Again, it\\'s up to you. Either choice will work.\\nTo transfer the crust to the pan, we find it easiest to roll a finished crust up onto the rolling pin, then gently unroll it in the pan. Or, you can fold it gently in quarters, lift it up, position the center point on the center of the pan, and unfold it into the pan. If using waxed paper, peel off the top layer, turn the crust gently into the pan, and peel off the remaining paper. Make sure that the dough is allowed to settle completely into the pan.\\nDon\\'t stretch and press the dough into the corners; stretched dough will likely shrink back when you bake it. Instead, lift the edges of the crust to let it settle down into the corners. If the dough tears a bit, don\\'t be concerned; we\\'ll patch it in a minute. Using scissors or a sharp knife, trim the dough to within 3/4-inch of the rim. Use any extra scraps to patch the crust, pressing with your fingers (wet them if necessary) or set aside.\\nWorking around the rim, turn the crust under itself (not under the rim of the pan) to make a thick edge, pressing it firmly against the pan to reduce shrinkage. To decorate the rim, just press it all around with the back of a fork. For a slightly more advanced look, press the thumb and forefinger of one hand together. Use them to gently push the thick dough rim outward, while pushing inward with the forefinger of the other hand, so that they intersect in a \"V\" with the dough in between. Repeat all around the rim to make a wavy edge. Chill 20 minutes before baking.\\nHeat the oven to 375 degrees. Line the inside of the chilled crust with aluminum foil (don\\'t turn down over the rim, but leave the extra sticking up so that you have something to hold on to). Fill the foil all the way up to the top of the shell with pie weights, rice, or dried beans. (Pie weights are reusable metal or ceramic pellets that hold the crust in place as it bakes. You can buy them at cooking supply stores.) Bake 25 to 30 minutes, until dry and beginning to turn \"blond\". Lift the foil and weights out of the shell and bake another 10 to 15 minutes, checking frequently to prevent overbaking, until medium brown.',\n",

Turn the pan on low and allow the butter to gently melt without browning. Once it is melted, tilt and swirl the pan to coat the bottom and the sides (this will help you slide the eggs out later).\\nOk, pay close attention: We are going to Frankenyolk these eggs. That means you'll make one egg have two yolks. (If you get lucky and get a double-yolk jumbo egg, go buy a lottery ticket.) Crack one egg into the pan. Then separate the second egg over a bowl, leaving just the yolk in one side of the shell and the whites in the bowl. Take the yolk in the shell and, using the edge of the shell, gently break the thick clear albumen (egg white) of the egg already in the pan and pour the separated yolk right next to the other yolk. Keep the yolks next to each other so they cook at the same time. Repeat this process with the rest of the eggs so you have 4 eggs with 2 yolks each. What to do with the whites? Make an egg white omelet the next day if you feel guilty. If not, how about a meringue pie for dessert tonight? Haaaiii!!\\nCook the eggs on medium-low heat until the whites are cooked through and the yolks are still runny. This takes a good 8 to 10 minutes, so be patient and work on the other steps. Brown edges on a fried egg are just wrong in my book. If the eggs finish before the other steps, just remove the pan(s) from the heat.\\nCook the refried beans: In a medium pot, add the oil and chorizo and cook on medium heat, using a wavy potato masher or wooden spoon to break the chorizo into bits to create crumbles like ground beef. Once the orange fat is rendered, add the onions, a tiny pinch of salt and cumin and the garlic and cook, stirring them into the chorizo. When the onions are tender and stained with the fat of the chorizo, add the refried beans and chopped pickled jalapenos. Cook until the beans are softened and loose. If they dry up a bit, add a splash of water or, if you are feeling slightly dangerous, add a bit of the pickling juice from the jalapenos. Keep warm.\\nChar the tortillas: In a large dry pan (cast-iron, please) or griddle over high heat, add the stack of tortillas. Cook and flip in a way that once the bottom tortilla is charred, it moves to the top of the stack, flipped. Continue to flip and alternate sides until each tortilla has had a date with the bottom of the pan. Time to build your plate!\\nBuild your plate: Place equal amount of the refried beans on each plate. Slightly level them out with the back of your spoon. Sprinkle each with an equal amount of cheese and then slide a double-yolk sunny-side up egg on top. Sprinkle some pico de gallo around the edges so you don't mess with the yolks.

Make sure you chopped the chocolate as finely as possible to allow it to melt quickly and easily. Place the chopped chocolate in a medium-size mixing bowl. Make a ganache by pouring about half of the hot cream over the chocolate and letting it sit for 30 seconds to melt the chocolate. Then, slowly whisk until smooth and homogenous. Do not add all of the hot cream to the cold chocolate at once. The shock of the temperature extremes will cause the fat in the chocolate to separate. As the chocolate melts, you will see some elasticity if there is no fat separation. This means the chocolate still has an emulsion; the fat molecules are still holding together. If the ganache separates, it loses its elasticity, collapses, and becomes very liquid. I use a hand-held immersion blender to ensure a smooth ganache and to keep the emulsion of the chocolate. Add the remaining cream gradually and mix until all of the hot cream is incorporated and the ganache is smooth and homogenous.\\nIf the ganache separates, it is very easy to fix. Simply add a small amount of cold cream and whisk well. This will bring the ganache back together. The ganache should be thick, shiny, and smooth. Add the desired flavoring and mix until fully incorporated. Pour the ganache onto a plastic wrap-covered baking sheet and spread evenly with a rubber spatula. Cover the ganache with plastic wrap and allow it to cool for at least 4 hours at room temperature. I usually make the ganache at the end of the day and let it cool overnight. As it cools, it will thicken and set.\\nWhen the ganache has cooled to the consistency of toothpaste, use an offset spatula to cover the cake layer with the ganache.',\n",

Mix the eggs and vanilla with a fork in a small bowl.\\nBeat the butter, granulated sugar and confectioners' sugar together in the bowl of a stand mixer on low speed until the butter has picked up the sugars, about 30 seconds. (If using a hand mixer, beat about 2 minutes.) Increase the speed to medium, and beat until slightly creamy, about 1 minute (about 3 minutes with a hand mixer), stopping halfway through to scrape the bowl.\\nReduce the speed to low, slowly add in the egg mixture and beat until combined. Add the flour mixture a heaping cup at a time, in 3 additions, stopping a few times to scrape the bowl and beaters (if using a hand mixer, increase the speed as the dough gets thicker to keep the beaters spinning). Once all the flour is just incorporated, increase the speed to medium (higher with a hand mixer), and beat until the dough is very smooth, about 2 minutes (about 5 minutes with a hand mixer).\\nTurn the dough out of the bowl and bring it together. Divide the dough into 3 even pieces, each about 13 ounces. Shape each piece into a 6-inch square and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate the dough for at least 3 hours or overnight.\\nWhile the dough chills, cut templates for the house from paper:\\n1 base, 8 by 8 inches\\n1 roof, 5 3/4 by 6 1/2 inches\\n2 slanted side walls, both 5 inches wide, one 4 inches high on the left and\\n3 inches high on the right, the other 3 inches high on the left and 4 inches high on the right, with optional windows cut out\\n1 front wall, 5 inches wide by 4 inches high, with a door cut out\\n1 back wall, 5 by 3 inches\\nTo roll, cut and bake the cookies and house: Position oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven, and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper (have extra parchment on hand). Take 2 of the dough pieces out of the refrigerator, and let them soften until just pliable but still cool and firm, about 15 minutes.\\nDust a piece of parchment with flour. Dust one square of dough with flour, and roll it out to about 1/4-inch thick (no thicker) and 9 to 10 inches square. Lift the dough occasionally to make sure it isn't sticking to the parchment. Cut out cookies with cutters; transfer to a prepared baking sheet, leaving 1 inch between them. Freeze while you cut the rest of the dough. Reserve the scraps for the house pieces. Take the last piece of dough from the refrigerator to soften.\\nDust the parchment and the second piece of dough with flour. Roll the dough about 1/4-inch thick and 9 to 10 inches square. Lay the base template on top, and use a pizza cutter or a very sharp knife to cut out the base. Peel off the scraps from the sides and reserve. Pick up the parchment with the base on it, put it on an unlined baking sheet and freeze while you finish cutting the other house pieces.\\nDust a third piece of parchment and the third piece of softened dough with flour. Roll the dough to about 1/4-inch thick and 11 by 7 inches. Put the roof and the front wall templates on top, and use the pizza cutter to cut the pieces. Transfer the pieces to the last prepared baking sheet, leaving 1 inch between them. Cut out a door from the front wall. Combine the scrap pieces with the reserved scraps, and gently knead together on the parchment; flour, roll to 1/4 inch thick and about 8 by 9 inches and cut out the remaining walls. Transfer the pieces to the baking sheet, leaving 1 inch between them. Cut out windows from the walls. Freeze for 10 minutes before baking.\\nBake the house pieces until golden brown around the edges, about 20 minutes. Rotate the pans front to back and bottom to top halfway through the baking time. Let cool completely on the baking sheets on a cooling rack, about 30 minutes.\\nWhile the house pieces cool, dust the cookies with sanding sugar if using, and bake until very light golden brown, about 16 minutes. Let cool 15 minutes on the baking sheet, then transfer to a cooling rack to completely, about 30 minutes.\\nTo assemble the house: Put 1/3 cup royal icing in a pastry bag fitted with the larger pastry tip. Place the roof browned-side up on a work surface with one of the short sides facing you. Pipe a thick 5-inch line of frosting along the short side 1 inch in from the edge. Let the icing harden while you build the rest of the house. (This will prevent the roof of the house from sliding off.)\\nPut the base on a large platter or board on which it will be displayed. Next, assemble the house using the royal icing as glue and making sure to turn the walls lighter-sides out: Hold up one of the side walls and pipe a line of icing along the bottom and up both sides. Set it down while you hold up the back wall and pipe a line of icing along its bottom edge. Stick these two pieces together on the base with the icing, pressing them gently together so they adhere. Hold the pieces for a few seconds, until they can stand on their own. Repeat with the other side wall and the front wall, pressing all four walls together.\\nReserve the royal icing in the pastry bag. Whisk water about 1 teaspoon at a time into the rest of the icing to thin it slightly to the consistency of molasses. Transfer to a pastry bag fitted with the smaller pastry tip.\\nTo decorate the house: Decorate the walls as desired: Use the thin icing for piping lines and decorations and for decorating the cookies. Use the thick icing to glue heavy pieces of candy to the sides and roof of the house. To make a grassy yard, spread a thin layer of icing with a butter knife around the base of the house. Press some of the coconut grass into the icing. Put some coconut grass inside the house (you don't need to ice inside). Decorate the yard as desired. Fill the house with candy and cookies (make sure the icing has set).\\nSet the roof on top, lighter-side up (don't attach it), and decorate as desired.\\nCombine 2 cups of the confectioners' sugar and the meringue powder with a fork in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. (Alternatively, use a hand mixer and medium bowl.) Add 3 tablespoons of water, and mix on low speed until smooth and thick, with a consistency like caulk. (If using a hand mixer, beat about 3 minutes.) If the icing seems a bit loose, mix in a tablespoon of confectioners' sugar at a time until thickened. Transfer to a clean bowl, and lay a damp piece of paper towel on top. Cover tightly until ready to use.\\nToss half the coconut and 3 drops food coloring with a fork in a medium bowl until the coconut is uniformly green. Add the remaining coconut, and toss gently to combine. Cover tightly and set aside.\",\n",

Reduce the heat to 325 degrees F, and continue cooking the ham for 1 hour. Sprinkle the powdered sugar on top, and cook for another 30 minutes, until nicely glazed. Transfer the ham to a platter, and set it aside in a warm place while you make the peach sauce. Discard the accumulated fat in the roasting pan, and add the 1 cup of water to the drippings in the pan, stirring to loosen and mix in the solidified juices. Add the demi-glace, and bring to a boil. Reserve for use in peach sauce.\\nFor the peach sauce: Heat the butter in two large skillets, 2 tablespoons of butter per skillet. When it is hot, add half of the peach wedges to each skillet, and saute for 2 to 3 minutes. Sprinkle with the sugar, dividing it between the skillets, and continue cooking for 3 to 4 minutes longer. Add the dried peach julienne and the vinegar, half to each skillet, and stir to mix. Combine the contents of both skillets in one saucepan. Strain the reserved demi-glace mixture over the peaches, and stir in the salt. If the sauce is thinner than you would like, add the dissolved potato starch, and bring to a boil. Boil 1 or 2 minutes. At serving time, stir in the basil.\\nTo make carving easier, make a vertical cut down into the ham approximately 1-inch above the shank bone. The object is to make a guard that your knife will not go beyond when you slice the ham; this will give a clean bottom edge to the slices and also protect your hand from the knife in case it happens to slide while you are slicing the meat. Slice the ham on the bias, stopping at the cut edge, and arrange the meat on a warm platter. Serve 3 or 4 slices of ham per person with few slices of the peaches and the sauce spooned around and over the meat.',\n",

I like to work on a marble surface because the marble is generally cold, which helps the chocolate set. I also keep my chocolate in a glass bowl, which retains heat well and holds the temper longer. One of the most useful things you can use when working with chocolate is acetate (plastic from the florist). It can be found in most art shops.\\nTo make dark and white chocolate cigarettes: Use a cake comb to create alternating stripes of white and dark chocolate. You can buy one at most cake decorating supply stores. Spread some white chocolate on a sheet of acetate in a very thin layer, about 1/16-inch. Draw the comb through the chocolate to create alternating lines. Return the excess chocolate to the bowl. When the chocolate stripes are firm but not hard, use an offset spatula to spread a 1/8-inch-thick layer of dark chocolate over the white chocolate. When the chocolate sets but is not firm, use a pastry triangle to create the cigarettes. Start about 11/2 inches from an edge and push the chocolate into a roll (it will form naturally). Apply even pressure.\\nTo make chocolate fans: Spread some dark chocolate directly onto the marble surface in a very thin layer, about 1/16-inch. Use the pastry triangle to create fans by pushing the triangle through the chocolate in an arc. Use your finger to hold down one side as you push the chocolate toward the other.',\n",

Remove from the heat and add the mussels and 1/4 cup of the vermouth. Return the skillet to the stove and cook for 1 minute. Add about 3/4 cup water. The mussels shouldn't take long to cook, about 2 minutes. Take care to stir the mussels from time to time so they cook as evenly as possible. Use tongs to pluck the mussels from the pan as they open. When all of the mussels are open, remove them and strain the liquid, reserving it for the sauce. Remove the mussels from their shells. Discard the shells.\\nCook the mushrooms: Rinse the skillet and return it to high heat until it smokes lightly. Remove the pan from the heat, add 1 tablespoon of the butter, and swirl the pan until the butter turns a light brown color. Return the skillet to the heat and immediately add the shallots and mushrooms. Season lightly with salt and the red pepper flakes. Cook the mushrooms until they start to give up liquid and brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the remaining 1/4 cup vermouth and cook for 1 minute. Season to taste with salt. Toast the hazelnuts: Meanwhile, in a small skillet, melt 1 tablespoon of the butter over medium heat and add the hazelnuts. Season them lightly with salt and toast them over low heat until they turn light brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove the hazelnuts and transfer them to a cutting board. Roughly chop the hazelnuts.\\nMake the sauce: Transfer the mushrooms to a plate using a slotted spoon. If there is any cooking liquid from the mushrooms, combine it with the mussel cooking liquid in a small saucepan. Simmer over low heat for 1 minute. The sauce may need a pinch of salt. The flavor should be an initial taste of sweet mussel followed by an undertone of earthiness from the mushroom. Swirl in 1 tablespoon of the butter and a touch of lemon juice. Keep warm.\\nAssemble the dish: Heat a large skillet over high heat until hot, 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter. When it turns light brown, return the skillet to the burner and add the mussels and mushrooms in a single layer. Cook for 1 minute without stirring them. They should be browned on their first side before you stir them slightly, with a wooden spoon, and leave them to brown for an additional minute. Stir in the sauce. Taste for seasoning. Toss in the hazelnuts. Serve immediately on a platter, family style, with slices of grilled bread.\",\n",

All you are doing in this recipe is freezing water.\\nSelect flexible silicone molds to create the sculpture base and cake stand. I used 3 molds. For the sculpture base, I used a small sunflower and centered it in the mold (place flowers upside down). When the flower is in place, fill the mold 1/3 full with water.

When the water has frozen, remove the mold from the freezer and add more water so the mold is 2/3\\'s full. Return the mold to the freezer. The mold must be filled in stages to keep the previously frozen ice from floating to the top of the mold. When the additional water is frozen, remove from the freezer, fill the mold with water and return to the freezer. Repeat these steps using the other molds and use any flowers or fresh leaves to decorate your sculpture.\\nApply the same technique to plastic water bottle that has been cut to size.

Place water, sugar and corn syrup in the pan and stir gently to combine. Place pan over medium heat and as sugar dissolves, swirl pan gently. Let mixture come to a rolling boil and, once boiling and mixture is clear, don't stir or swirl pan anymore. If, while sugar is boiling, any sugar crystals cling to sides of pan, use moistened pastry brush to wash sides of the pan. Cook syrup until starts becoming a very light amber color. Lower heat and add butter, one half stick at a time, stirring very gently. (Only add additional butter after preceding piece has become melted and fully incorporated.) Once all the butter has been added, place candy thermometer into mixture, making sure that the bottom tip does not touch the bottom of the pan. Raise heat to medium and boil mixture until the temperature reads between 295 degrees F and 300 degrees F. Remove thermometer from pan and pan from stove and immediately stir in salt, baking soda, vanilla and macadamia nuts. (Quickly stick thermometer it warm water to aid in clean up.) Immediately, pour candy mixture onto prepared baking sheet. Brush the bottom of a long offset metal spatula (an icing spatula is perfect) or a knife with some melted butter. Spread the candy mixture out so that it is 1/4-inch thick. Use the knife to push the sides back into a rectangular shape as the mixture cools. Let the mixture set for a few minutes.\\nTo melt chocolate: While toffee firms up a bit, melt chocolate in the top of a double boiler or in a skillet with 1 inch of hot but not simmering water (stirring constantly until smooth). Be careful not to allow any water to enter bowl of chocolate.\\nTo cut candy: While candy mixture is still warm and pliable, use a buttered pastry scraper to score the candy into 1 1/2 by 2inch rectangles. Let set further until the candy is firmer (5 minutes at room temperature). Score again through original cuts, making sure candy is in separate squares all the way through to the bottom. ( If stubborn, use your pastry scraper and mallet to knock through any sticky, tough spots. Hit the top (wooden part) of the scraper with a heavy mallet.)\\nTo fully assemble candy and chill: When chocolate is firm, pour melted chocolate over top of scored candy and, using a spatula, spread it out evenly. It's okay if the chocolate runs down into grooves in candy. Scatter 2 cups of the ground toasted nuts on top of the chocolate and press them into the chocolate. Reserve the remaining 1 cup of nuts. Lift one end of the parchment paper so the first line of cut candy bends and separates from the next line. Carefully lift one piece off at a time.

A brine is a slower process where the rub, sugar and salt are diluted to penetrate the protein and break it down so that the meat is juicy, flavorful and tender after cooked. I love brined pork and chicken, but if I am cooking late and didn't think about it the day before, I will have to do a nice rub on the meat, which is just more concentrated and expedited, and that's what I have here. Pork chops go with so many accompaniments but I do love the acidity of apples or an applesauce with pork chops and the bite of mustard greens. You can use mizuna, or arugula if you cannot find mustard greens. Also, you can put a schmear of hot mustard mixed with a little honey or molasses on the plate instead for the kick. I like onion rings, in general. My other favorite accompaniment to pork chops is kimchee tossed with some fresh fruit such as peaches or plums.\\nTo cook the pork chops: Grind all the spices together with the sugar and rub all over the pork chops. Set aside for 30 minutes to an hour at room temperature.\\nPreheat the grill on high or heat a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat on the stovetop and preheat the oven to 375 degrees (Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to the pan if cooking in cast iron).\\nCook the pork on one side for 4 to 5 minutes on the grill or in cast iron. Flip over and cook for another 4 to 5 minutes on the grill; if cooking in cast iron, flip the chop and transfer to the oven for 4 to 5 minutes. Set aside to rest for 5 minutes.\\nTo cook the sauteed apples: In a medium saute pan over medium-high heat, combine the sugar, 1 tablespoon water and a drop of lemon juice. Cook until sugar caramelizes to golden brown. Turn off the heat and add the apple slices and star anise. Return the pan to medium-high heat, stir in the butter and remaining lemon juice. Saute, stirring, for 2 minutes, adding the brandy in the last minute of cooking with a pinch of salt. Simmer briefly to burn off the alcohol and thicken the caramel. Set aside.\\nTo cook the onion rings: Bring the canola oil to 360 degrees F in a large pot. Combine the flour, cornstarch, salt and pepper in a bowl. Pour the buttermilk into a shallow dish or bowl. Dip the onion rings in the flour mixture to dredge, shaking off any excess. Dip in the buttermilk to coat, and then back into the flour mixture. Shake off any excess flour. Working in batches, fry the rings until light golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain on paper towels and sprinkle with salt.\\nServe the pork chops with the sauteed apples, onion rings and mustard greens.\",\n",

Brush 3 (12 1/2 by 9-inch) rimmed baking sheets (otherwise known as quarter sheet pans) with melted butter. Line the pans with parchment paper, leaving a few inches of overhang on opposite sides. Butter the top of the parchment paper as well, then set aside.\\nIn the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the almond paste and sugar on medium speed until well combined, about 5 minutes. Add the almond extract. Roughly cut the room temperature butter into pats and gradually add to the almond paste-sugar mixture. Beat until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl if needed. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating to combine after each addition. Add the flour and salt and beat until just combined.\\nDivide the batter evenly among the prepared baking sheets, about 2 1/4 cups each sheet, smoothing the batter out with an offset spatula. Gently tap the baking sheet on the table to remove any air pockets in the batter. Air pockets will cause holes in the baked cake and give a ragged look to the finished product. Bake until just set, but not browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Give the baking sheets a turn halfway through baking, after about 8 minutes, for even baking, if needed, but don't worry too much because we're covering the cakes. Test with a toothpick or skewer and if clean, remove from the oven and transfer to wire racks to cool.\\nTo make the jam easier to spread and to prevent tearing the cake, puree the raspberry jam in a food processor. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Turn 1 cake layer out onto the lined baking sheet. Spread half of the raspberry jam in an even layer over the cake. Carefully flip the cake out of the baking sheet and top with a second cake layer. Spread with the remaining jam. Carefully flip the final layer out of the baking sheet and top the cake. Place a piece of parchment paper over the final layer and top with a second baking sheet. Weigh down with 2 large (28-ounce) cans. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour and up to overnight.\\nRemove the cake from the refrigerator and cut into 1-inch squares. Place onto a wire racks over at least 2 baking sheets, leaving at least 1-inch between each cake piece.\\nPlace each of the tinted royals icings in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water, with the bottom of the bowl not touching the water, until pourable. You should have about 8 cups total. You'll be using about 1 heaping tablespoon icing on each. Carefully place a cut cake on a chocolate fork/dipper (or a small fork). Place the cake over the icing and spoon the icing onto the cake. If the cake drops into the icing, carefully pick it up with your spoon and place back onto your fork/dipper. Place back onto the wire rack using another dipper or fork to slide onto the wire rack. Top with decorative dragees, as desired. Repeat with the remaining icing and cakes. Alternately, for each tinted frosting, set 3 cooling racks over baking sheets and divide the cut cake pieces evenly among the racks. Pour the tinted frosting slowly over the cake pieces. If you need extra frosting, just remove the cooling rack, scrape the excess frosting from the baking sheet, melt or microwave until pourable and touch up any area that the frosting didn't coat the first time. Let stand until set, about 30 minutes at room temperature or cover and place in the refrigerator for up to 1 week until ready to serve.\\nPut your raspberries and 1/4 cup water in a saucepan over medium heat. Once it's at a simmer, partially cover and cook 8 to 10 minutes. Pass the berry mixture through a food mill and measure the liquid that remains. You need 3 1/2 cups. Add more water if there isn't enough.\\nPut the berry liquid into a new saucepan over medium heat and bring to a simmer again. Once it simmers, start adding your sugar in 1/2 cup increments. Give it a stir to incorporate and bring it back to a simmer before adding of the next 1/2 cup sugar. Once the last 1/2 cup is added, bring the liquid to 216 to 218 degrees F on a candy thermometer. Stir constantly.\\nLet this cool to room temperature prior to using. If not using right away, refrigerate for up to 1 week. Yield: 2 cups.\\nIn a large heatproof bowl, combine 1 1/4 cups plus 1 tablespoon water, corn syrup and almond extract. Once incorporated, slowly whisk in the sugar until fully combined. Alternately, slowly mix together in a stand mixer and transfer to a heatproof bowl prior to icing cakes.\\nDivide the icing into 3 heatproof bowls. To make a pale green color, add a little less than 1 drop green food coloring to the first bowl. To the second bowl, add 1 drop purple coloring for a lavender color.

Let cool, then transfer to a food processor and pulse until finely ground. Transfer to a medium bowl; add the flour, baking powder, baking soda and kosher salt and whisk to combine.\\nBeat the butter and sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in the eggs one at a time, scraping down the bowl as needed. Beat in the orange zest. Reduce the mixer speed to low; beat in the flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with the sour cream, beginning and ending with flour, until just smooth.\\nArrange the orange segments in the cake pan in concentric circles. Add the batter and smooth the top. Bake until golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. (Tent with foil if the top gets too dark.) Transfer to a rack and let cool slightly, then run a knife around the edge of the cake and invert onto a platter. Let cool completely. Sprinkle with sea salt.\\nPhotograph by Kana Okada\",\n",

On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out into a large rectangle, with the short sides at the bottom and the top, about 1/4 inch thick. Use a slotted spoon to transfer half the apples to the bottom half of the rectangle. Leave most of the apple liquid behind. Fold the top half of the dough over the bottom half. Press the dough down to seal in the apples. Spread the rest of the apples, without too much of that liquid, on the right half of the dough square. Then fold the left half of the dough over the apples and press to seal.

Spread the pecans out on a baking sheet, and bake until they turn a few shades darker and are nicely toasted, about 15 minutes. Let cool, then halve each pecan lengthwise.\\nMeanwhile, heat the cream, butter, corn syrup, vanilla and salt in a small saucepan over medium heat until just steaming. Reduce the heat to low to keep the cream mixture warm.\\nCook the sugar in an even layer in a medium skillet over medium heat, without stirring, until it begins to melt. Gently swirl the pan as needed as the sugar continues to melt and begins to caramelize and turn lightly golden in spots. Keep cooking and swirling until the caramel is a uniform deep amber. Remove from the heat, and slowly whisk in the warm cream mixture (watch out for ferocious bubbles). Return the caramel sauce to medium heat, and cook to reduce slightly, about 2 minutes. Let cool. To see if the sauce is ready for topping the cheesecake, dip a spoon into it and let the sauce drop off; it's ready if it easily and slowly drips off the spoon. (The sauce can be refrigerated up to 2 days; reheat in the microwave.)\\nTo assemble: Spoon the sauce into the center of the cheesecake, and let it ooze to the edge. If needed, swirl the sauce with the back of a spoon to help it along. Sprinkle the pecans in a generous layer over the sauce. The cheesecake can now be served or refrigerated for up to 4 hours.\\nTo slice the cake, dip a sharp, heavy knife into warm water, wipe the knife dry and slice into the cake. Wipe the knife clean and repeat.\",\n",

Allow the duck to sit 3 to 4 hours. Remove from the refrigerator and wipe the rendered fat from the skin of the duck. In a medium saucepan, combine the marinade ingredients and cook over low to medium heat until thickened. (Do not boil. This will give the marinade a burnt taste due to the amount of brown sugar). Allow the marinade to cool then brush the duck generously with the mixture. (Reserve some of the marinade to baste the duck with while roasting.) Refrigerate 6 to 8 hours or overnight. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the duck in a roasting pan and roast for 15 minutes, basting with the reserved marinade every 5 minutes. Remove the duck from the oven and let rest 10 minutes. Remove the breasts from the bone and the thighs with the legs attached. Place the thigh/legs into a medium saucepan pan with 1-inch of water in it. Cover the pan and place in the 350 degree oven for approximately 40 minutes or until the meat falls off the bone. Remove from the oven and set aside. When cool enough to handle pick the meat from the bone and tear into bite sized-pieces. Just before serving, place the breasts in a oven-proof skillet skin-side-down and heat 6 to 8 minutes (depending on your preference of doneness, i.e. rare, medium rare). Slice the breasts very thinly on the bias (each breast should yield 3 servings).

In a blender, combine the orange syrup, vinegar, honey and chili powder (if using). Blend for 30 seconds. With the blender running, slowly add the olive oil until the dressing emulsifies. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Pour into a plastic squeeze bottle. (May be prepared up to 1 day ahead and refrigerated.) Bring to room temperature before serving.\\nMake the sauteed pears: In a medium skillet over medium-high heat, melt the butter, sugar and cinnamon and cook to a light syrup.

Using a rubber spatula, fold about one-third of the beaten egg whites into the ricotta mixture, then gently fold in the rest until just combined. Scrape the batter into the prepared crust. Bake until slightly puffed and lightly golden on top, about 1 hour, 20 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool, 20 minutes. Run a knife around the edge of the cake to loosen, then remove the springform ring and let cool completely. Combine the confectioners' sugar and cinnamon in a fine-mesh sieve and dust over the cheesecake. Scatter the remaining 1/3 cup toasted almonds on top and dust again. Serve at room temperature.

Cut 3 circles of waxed or parchment paper to fit the bottoms of the pans, then press them in. In a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or using a hand mixer,) cream the butter until smooth. Add the sugar and eggs and mix until fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add the vanilla, cocoa, baking soda and salt; mix. Add half of the flour, then half of the sour cream, and mix. Repeat with the remaining flour and sour cream. Drizzle in the hot coffee and mix until smooth. The batter will be thin.\\nPour into the prepared pans and bake until the tops are firm to the touch and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean (a few crumbs are okay) about 35 minutes. Halfway through the baking, quickly rotate the pans in the oven to ensure even baking, but otherwise try not to open the oven. Let cool in the pan 10 minutes. Turn out onto wire racks and let cool completely before frosting.\\nTo frost the cake, use a spatula to cover 2 of the cake layers with frosting. Stack them together. Flip the third cake layer over and rest it on the top to create a very flat top for the cake. Frost on the sides and top with a thin \"crumb\" layer to seal all the crumbs in and chill. Repeat with a finishing layer of butter cream. Place about 2 cups of butter cream in a potato ricer and press it through onto the top of the cake moving it in a circular motion to look like spaghetti. Place chocolate truffle meatballs around on top and chill until ready to serve. Just before serving, pour on the strawberry puree.\\nIn a saucepan place the sugar and carefully pour the water around the edge. Using your finger make an X in the pan to help the water gently mix with the sugar. Bring to a boil and cook to softball stage (235 degrees F.) Meanwhile, whip the egg whites in a mixer with a whip attachment until light and fluffy. When sugar is softball slowly pour it into the bowl down the side and continue whipping, adding vanilla, until incorporated and then cooled. Add the butter 1 cube at a time while whipping until it is a thick butter cream (check flavor and consistency of butter cream before continuing to add butter, as not all of the 2 cups may be needed). Keep at room temperature while frosting the cake.\\nHeat the heavy cream in a small saucepan, and as soon as it boils, turn off the heat. Meanwhile, put the chopped bittersweet chocolate in a medium bowl. Pour the hot cream into the bowl. Whisk until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth, add the peanut butter and whisk until smooth. Cover and let rest in a cool place overnight--do not refrigerate. The mixture will become firm but not hard.\\nThe next day, scoop balls of truffle mixture using an ice cream scoop onto baking sheets lined with parchment paper. Refrigerate until set, about 1 hour.

Add the shallots and garlic to the pan and sweat them for 1 minute. Throw in the thyme, marjoram, bay leaf, cloves, and juniper berry and sweat for 1 minute. Add the red wine and let the mixture simmer until the wine is mostly cooked off and the sauce starts to thicken slightly, about 20 to 25 minutes. Stir in 1/2 cup of the demi glace, cook for 1 minute, then taste. If the sauce needs a little more richness, add more demi glace until it tastes evenly rich and smooth. Stir in the butter until it is just melted. Taste the sauce again and season with salt, and pepper, if necessary.\\nFor the steak and turf:\\nPreheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Preheat a grill or cast iron pan over high heat.\\nRemove the steak from the refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking so the meat is at room temperature. This helps the meat to cook evenly. Coat the steak in 2 tablespoons olive oil. Season the steak with salt, and pepper. Sear the steak on both sides, about 2 minutes per side, until browned. Transfer the steak to the oven for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from the oven and let rest before slicing. While the steak is in the oven, season the fish well with salt and pepper. Wrap thin slices of potato around each piece of fish, overlapping slightly. Do this with each slice overlapping the last by 1/4-inch until the fish is wrapped. Heat a nonstick pan over medium heat and add 1 tablespoon olive oil. Season the potato-wrapped fish with salt and pepper and add the fish to the pan with the potato overlap facing down. This will help seal the potatoes on the fish. Cook each side until the potato is crispy and fish is cooked through. Transfer the cooked fish to a paper towel. Keep warm.\\nFor the mushrooms:\\nMelt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the corn to the pan and cook until lightly browned. Remove the corn from the pan to a bowl. Add another 1 tablespoon of butter and then stir in the shallots. Cook the shallots until softened, about 5 minutes. Remove the shallots to the bowl with the corn. Add in the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and raise the heat to medium-high. Add the mushrooms and cook until they start to brown, but are still firm. Add the sherry vinegar and stir. Simmer until reduced down and almost cooked out. Add the corn and shallots back into the pan. Stir to combine. Season the mushrooms with salt and pepper. Keep warm.\\nFor the leeks:\\nIn a large, deep saute pan over medium heat, melt the butter. Add the leeks and shallots and sweat the leeks and shallots for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Season the mixture with salt and pepper. Add the wine and bring to a simmer and let the wine cook all the way down until it is almost cooked out. Add the stock and repeat the reduction process. Add the cream and reduce the heat to medium-low and let simmer until the leeks and shallots are tender and the sauce begins to thicken. Season the mixture with salt, and pepper again, if needed.\\nTo plate:\\nSlice the steak into thin slices. Make a bed of mushrooms on each plate. Top with slices of steak and a piece of fish.

Store the Mendiants in an airtight container at room temperature for up to one week.\\nHow to Temper Chocolate(From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres):\\nChocolate is tempered so that after it has been melted, it retains its gloss and hardens again without becoming chalky and white (that happens when the molecules of fat separate and form on top of the chocolate). There are a variety of ways to temper.\\nOne of the easiest ways to temper chocolate is to chop it into small pieces and then place it in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time on high power until most of the chocolate is melted. Be very careful not to overheat it. (The temperature of dark chocolate should be between 88 and 90 degrees F, slightly warmer than your bottom lip. It will retain its shape even when mostly melted. White and milk chocolates melt at a temperature approximately 2 degrees F less because of the amount of lactose they contain.) Any remaining lumps will melt in the chocolate\\'s residual heat. Use an immersion blender or whisk to break up the lumps. Usually, chocolate begins to set, or crystallize, along the side of the bowl. As it sets, mix those crystals into the melted chocolate to temper it. A glass bowl retains heat well and keeps the chocolate tempered longer.\\nAnother way to temper chocolate is called seeding. In this method, add small pieces of unmelted chocolate to melted chocolate. The amount of unmelted chocolate to be added depends on the temperature of the melted chocolate, but is usually 1/4 of the total amount. It is easiest to use an immersion blender for this, or a whisk.\\nThe classic way to temper chocolate is called tabliering. Two thirds of the melted chocolate is poured onto a marble or another cold work surface. The chocolate is spread out and worked with a spatula until its temperature is approximately 81 degrees F. At this stage, it is thick and begins to set. This tempered chocolate is then added to the remaining non-tempered chocolate and mixed thoroughly until the mass has a completely uniform temperature. If the temperature is still too high, part of the chocolate is worked further on the cold surface until the correct temperature is reached. This is a lot of work, requires a lot of room, and makes a big mess.\\nA simple method of checking tempering, is to apply a small quantity of chocolate to a piece of paper or to the point of a knife. If the chocolate has been correctly tempered, it will harden evenly and show a good gloss within a few minutes.\\nHow to Make a Cornet(From Dessert Circus, Extraordinary Desserts You Can Make At Home by Jacques Torres):\\nThe Cornet: A cornet is a small piping bag made from parchment paper. It is usually used to make fine decorations.\\nCut an 8 by 12 by 14 1/2-inch triangle from a sheet of parchment paper. Hold the middle of the long side of the triangle between two fingers of one hand. Take the tip of the triangle on the short, wide end and roll it toward the other tip of that same end while simultaneously pulling it in an upward motion. The tip of a cone will form where your thumb and finger hold it on the long side.\\nRelease your grip from the long side, so that you are now holding the two corners where they meet. The paper will already resemble a partially formed cone. Roll the remaining tail until it is completely rolled into a cone. There will be one point sticking up from the open end. Fold it inside toward the center, and crease the fold. Now you should have a cornet. To close the cornet once it has been filled, fold it away from the seam; this will keep the seam from opening. Use a pair of scissors or a sharp paring knife to cut an opening at the tip of the cornet to the desired size.',\n",
